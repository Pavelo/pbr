An SFC file stores data about a surfels cloud generated starting from a polygonal mesh. It is organized as follows.
Beginning from the first line of an SFC file there are:
- extension of the file
- integer number representing the total number of surfels
- integer number representing the size of the texture map
- tridimensional coordinates of each surfel
- tridimensional coordinates of each surfel normal
- wich texel the surfel is mapped on, wich face the surfel belongs to
- line feed

Note the surfels data is NOT interlaced.
